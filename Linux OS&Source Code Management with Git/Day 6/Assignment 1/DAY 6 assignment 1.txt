DAY 6
Assignment 1: Initialize a new Git repository in a directory of your choice. Add a simple text file to the repository and make the first commit.
A)

Sure, here are the steps to initialize a new Git repository, add a text file, and make the first commit:

1.Navigate to the directory where you want to initialize the Git repository. For example, if you want to create a repository in a folder named "my_project", you can use the cd command to     change to that directory:

            cd path/to/my_project

2.Initialize a new Git repository. Use the git init command to create a new Git repository in the current directory:

              git init

3.Create a simple text file. You can create a new text file using any text editor. For example, if you're on a Unix-like system, you can use nano, vim, or gedit. If you're on Windows, you can use Notepad or any other text editor.

4.Add the text file to the Git repository. Use the git add command to stage the text file for commit. Replace filename.txt with the actual name of your text file:

          git add filename.txt

5.Commit the changes. Use the git commit command to commit the staged changes to the repository. This command will open a text editor for you to write a commit message. If you want to skip the text editor, you can use the -m flag followed by your commit message:

         git commit -m "Initial commit: Added filename.txt"
#!/bin/bash

# Navigate to the directory
cd /path/to/your/directory

# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Create a simple text file
echo "Hello, Git!" > myfile.txt

# Add the text file to the Git repository
git add myfile.txt

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: Added myfile.txt"

Save this script with a .sh extension (e.g., initialize_git_repo.sh) and make it executable with the command chmod +x initialize_git_repo.sh. Then you can run the script by executing ./initialize_git_repo.sh. It will perform all the steps automatically.
